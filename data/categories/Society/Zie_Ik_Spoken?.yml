--- {name: Zie Ik Spoken?, description: 'Citizens first complete an extensive questionnaire
about who they are, what their sleeping habits are and whether they sometimes feel
like seeing, hearing, feeling or smelling things that are not there. Then they play
a game where they have to press a certain key when they see a specific item of clothing
or hear a specific word in a movie. Finally, they receive a few questions about substance
use (drugs and alcohol) and the project concludes with a hearing test.', category: Society,
