name: Zie Ik Spoken?
description: Citizens first complete an extensive questionnaire about who they are,
  what their sleeping habits are and whether they sometimes feel like seeing, hearing,
  feeling or smelling things that are not there. Then they play a game where they
  have to press a certain key when they see a specific item of clothing or hear a
  specific word in a movie. Finally, they receive a few questions about substance
  use (drugs and alcohol) and the project concludes with a hearing test.
