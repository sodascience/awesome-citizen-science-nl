name: Witte Gebieden
description: 'Citizens (mostly florists) reserve a ‚ÄúWit Gebied‚Äù beforehand. These
  are areas where florists are not as active, so there are less observations compared
  to other areas. Florists then visit such an area for a maximum of one day and fill
  in lists of what they found in the area that covers at least three ‚Äúkilometerhokken‚Äù. '
