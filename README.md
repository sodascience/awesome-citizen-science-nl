## Contribute or update project

Everyone is welcome to add a new citizen science project (from the Netherlands) to this
list. To keep the contribution process simple and fast, we ask you to follow
the guide below:

1. Search [previous Pull Requests](https://github.com/sodascience/awesome-citizen-science-nl/pulls) before making a new one, as your project may be a duplicate.

2. Browse to the [`data/categories`](data/categories) folder of this repository.

3. Select the category that belongs to the project you want to add and browse to that folder. If you cannot find the category that fits your project, go directly to step **4**.

4. Above the list of files, using the **Add file** drop-down, click **Create new file**.

5. In the file name field, type the name of the file and use as extension `yml`. For example: `NAME_OF_NEW_PROJECT.yml`. If you did not find the cateogry that fits your project, you need to add the new category name before the name of your project, for example: `NEW_CATEGORY/NAME_OF_NEW_PROJECT.yml`.

6. On the **Edit new file** tab, copy and paste the content below and fill it in with the information concerning your project. Next to each attribute, we provided a small description of the content we ask you to fill in. Please do follow these indications as it will speed up the process of review. If one or more attributes are unknown to you, feel free to leave the attribute empty (e.g. `data_accessibility: `). Finally, before proposing a new project remember to delete the comments (everything from "#" onwards) leaving only your newly added content.

```yaml
---
name: # Official name of the project. | *Compulsory
description: # Description of the project. Please try to summarise the main aim of the project. | *Compulsory
main_category: # Main category used to classify the project, choose only one! | *Compulsory
extra_categories: # Additional categories under which the project may be classified
organization: # Organizer(s) of the project
country: The Netherlands
location: # Regions/ Provinces included in the project
notes_location: # Additional notes on the location of the project (e.g. if specific regions are included/ excluded)
start_date: # Fill in the starting year
end_date: # If the project is ended, fill in the ending year
status: # Choose from: ongoing, recurring or ended
notes_duration: # Additional notes on the duration of the project
data_accessibility: # Choose from: Viewable, Probably viewable, Probably viewable once finished, No direct download
accessibility_for_research: # Choose from: yes, no or unsure
data_url: # Url to the main source of the project's data, if not available please use '-'
project_information_url: # Url to the main page of the project | *Compulsory
```

7. At the bottom of the page, in the **Propose new file** box add a title describing the new file you added. It might be also very simple as: `Add PROJECT NAME, DATE START - DATE END`. You might also specify the new addition further in the *optional extended description field*.
